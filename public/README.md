# Mario vs Birdo
This project is a simulation of a boss fight between Birdo and Mario from the Super Mario Advance Game Boy game which I mastered as a child. Mario will collect carrots and eggs to throw at Birdo while she is trying to egg him down. First one hit the other one 5 times is the winner! 

A behavior tree-like if-and-else statement structure is deciding how mario should act, while Birdo is more simple-minded and moves back and forth while shooting eggs.
