Mario will collect carrots and eggs to throw at Birdo while she is trying to egg him down. First one to hit the other one 5 times is the winner! 
A behavior tree-like if-and-else statement structure is deciding how mario should act, while Birdo is more simple-minded and moves back and forth while shooting eggs.</p>
